Question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

I am comparing usage behaviour between two groups: member (annual members) vs casual (single-ride and day-pass users)

2. What kind of differences are we looking for?

Ride Count	-> Do members or casual riders take more trips overall?	Shows engagement and frequency
Ride Duration	-> Who takes longer rides on average?	Indicates usage pattern (leisure vs. commute)
Day of Week ->	Do casual riders prefer weekends? Do members ride on weekdays?	Suggests the purpose of ride
Month -> Does seasonality affect users differently?	Helps with seasonal campaigns
Hour of Day ->	Are members riding during rush hours?	May point to commute usage
Popular Stations -> 	Are different start/end stations popular with each group?	Helps in targeted station-level marketing
Rideable Type -> Do both groups prefer the same bike types?	Could guide fleet management


Break It Down: 
Ask questions like:
Group Comparison: What if I group by member_casual â€” what patterns emerge?
Trend Detection: Can I observe consistent trends over time (week, month, hour)?
User Behaviour: Are casual riders more likely to ride on weekends? Is their average ride time longer?
Volume vs Duration: Is a higher ride count linked with lower average ride time for one group?

4. Prioritise the Most Impactful Insights
To help marketing teams, focus on:
When and how casual riders use the service (to find conversion opportunities)
What members do differently (to highlight the benefits of becoming a member)
