# Inventory Optimization Analysis for Mint Classics (SQL Project)

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world scenario where I step into the role of a data analyst at **Mint Classics Company**, a fictional retailer of collectible model vehicles.
The company is considering **closing one of its storage facilities** and requires **data-driven recommendations** to reorganise or reduce inventory while ensuring products can still be shipped within **24 hours** of customer orders.

## Scenario

Mint Classics is seeking to make strategic inventory decisions. They need insights on:

- Where products are stored and whether a warehouse can be eliminated.
- Whether inventory levels align with sales performance.
- Which items are underperforming and could be discontinued.

My role was to analyze a **relational SQL database** provided by the company and use **MySQL Workbench** to answer key business questions through structured queries and insights.

## Project Objectives

- Explore current inventory data across storage facilities.
- Identify patterns influencing inventory reduction or reorganization.
- Generate actionable insights to support closing one warehouse.
- Deliver recommendations backed by SQL analysis.

## Key Business Questions

1. **Storage Optimization**  
   Can products be reorganized to enable closing one of the warehouses?

2. **Sales Alignment**  
   Are inventory levels proportional to actual sales trends?

3. **Product Performance**  
   Are there slow-moving or obsolete items that can be phased out?

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)**
- **Relational Database (Mint Classics sample data)**
- **ERD / Data Model** *(Provided in project resources)*

## Process

1. Imported and explored the Mint Classics relational database.
2. Studied the data model and key relationships between tables.
3. Posed relevant business questions and drafted SQL queries.
4. Analyzed the data using SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and filtering clauses.
5. Summarized findings and compiled recommendations.

## Insights & Recommendations

üîπ Insights
1. Utilization Rate
South warehouse has the highest utilization (0.28), meaning it turns over stock faster than others.
East and West warehouses have lower utilization (0.16 and 0.18), which implies slower movement of inventory and higher holding costs.

2. Exclusive Product Holdings
East holds the highest number of exclusive products (38), meaning it stocks many items not available in other warehouses ‚Äî a critical factor for retention.
West has fewer exclusive products than East but still ranks high (24), suggesting some consolidation potential.

3. Zero Demand Products
East and West have more products that haven‚Äôt been ordered at all (4 and 3, respectively), indicating inefficiencies or overstocking.
North and South are leaner in this aspect, with only 2 and 1 zero-demand products.

4. Scoring Insights
Final scoring (a weighted average of utilization, exclusivity, and demand efficiency) shows North and South clearly leading.
West warehouse, despite having high-value items, ranks low on efficiency and demand alignment and lacks critical exclusivity ‚Äî making it the only candidate for potential closure under your current model.

üìå Recommendations
‚úÖ Retain North and South Warehouses
Both have solid utilization and fewer zero-demand products.
Their leaner operations suggest efficiency and flexibility.
Continue operations with current stock strategy, but keep optimizing demand forecasting.

üö™ Consider Closure of West Warehouse
Even though it holds several high-demand products, its low utilization and higher zero-demand rate reduce overall efficiency.
It lacks strategic exclusivity compared to East, making it easier to redistribute inventory.
If closure is pursued:
Relocate high-performing SKUs from West to North and South.
Discontinue or discount low-demand inventory before closure.
Ensure exclusive products are duplicated in remaining warehouses to avoid stockouts.

üîÅ Retain East but Optimize
High exclusive count makes East critical to retain.
However, low utilization and high zero-demand suggest poor product lifecycle management.
Implement SKU rationalization and better demand planning.
