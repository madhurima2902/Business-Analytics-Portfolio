# Inventory Optimization Analysis for Mint Classics (SQL Project)

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world scenario where I step into the role of an entry-level data analyst at **Mint Classics Company**, a fictional retailer of collectible model vehicles. The company is considering **closing one of its storage facilities** and requires **data-driven recommendations** to reorganize or reduce inventory while ensuring products can still be shipped within **24 hours** of customer orders.

## Scenario

Mint Classics is seeking to make strategic inventory decisions. They need insights on:

- Where products are stored and whether a warehouse can be eliminated.
- Whether inventory levels align with sales performance.
- Which items are underperforming and could be discontinued.

My role was to analyze a **relational SQL database** provided by the company and use **MySQL Workbench** to answer key business questions through structured queries and insights.

## Project Objectives

- Explore current inventory data across storage facilities.
- Identify patterns influencing inventory reduction or reorganization.
- Generate actionable insights to support closing one warehouse.
- Deliver recommendations backed by SQL analysis.

## Key Business Questions

1. **Storage Optimization**  
   Can products be reorganized to enable closing one of the warehouses?

2. **Sales Alignment**  
   Are inventory levels proportional to actual sales trends?

3. **Product Performance**  
   Are there slow-moving or obsolete items that can be phased out?

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)**
- **Relational Database (Mint Classics sample data)**
- **ERD / Data Model** *(Provided in project resources)*

## Process

1. Imported and explored the Mint Classics relational database.
2. Studied the data model and key relationships between tables.
3. Posed relevant business questions and drafted SQL queries.
4. Analyzed the data using SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and filtering clauses.
5. Summarized findings and compiled recommendations.

## Insights & Recommendations

This section will include:
- Products identified for potential removal from inventory
- Suggestions for redistributing stock between warehouses
- Recommendations for closing a specific storage facility
